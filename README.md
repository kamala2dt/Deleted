Test the Law of Large Numbers for N random normally distributed numbers with mean = 0, stdev = 1:
Create a Python script that will count how many of these numbers will fall between -1 and 1
and divide by the total quantity of N
You know that E(X) = 68.2%
Check that Mean(Xn) -> E(X) as you rerun your script by increasing N
